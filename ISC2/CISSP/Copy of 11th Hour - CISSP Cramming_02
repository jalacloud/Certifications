DOMAIN 1: Security Risk Management
****
Major Legal Systems
	- Civil Law (Judicial precedent and previous case rulings do not carry they weight they would under common law)
		- Also referred to as "Tort law"
	- Common Law
		1. Criminal Law
		2. Civil Law
		3. Administrative Law (Regulation and Gonvernment)
			- FCC Regulations
			- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
				- HITECH: 2009 update to HIPAA. 
					- Business Associates of HIPAA covered entities also subject to HIPAA regulations/privacy laws
					- BAA: Business Associate Agreement
			- FDA regulations
			- FAA regulations
	- Religious & Customary Law

Common Types of Financial Damages:
	1. Statutory - Damages are those prescribed by law. No actual loss or injury.
	2. Compensatory - Victim awarded financial compensation for loss or injury.
	3. Punitive - To punish an individual or organisation. Typically awarded to attempt to discourage an egregious violation.

TYPES OF LAWS:
	- FISMA: Federal Information Security Act of 2002
		- U.S law that requires every federal agency to create, document, and implement an agency-wide security program.
		- Provide protection for information and information systems.
		- Include those systems provided of managed by another agency, contractor, or other source.
		- Periodic assessments.
		- Places a significant burden on federal agencies and government contractors.
	- GISRA: Government Information Security Reform Act of 2000
		- Provides a comprehensive framework for establishing and ensuring effectiveness of controls over information resources - Federal.
		- Provide mechanisms for improved oversight of federal agency information security programs.
	- DMCA: Digital Millennium Copyright Act (1998)
		- Limits the liability of service providers (ISPs). Not liable for "transitory activities" of users.
		- Protection against unauthorized duplication of "original works"
		- Eight (8) broad categories:
			- Literary works
			- Musical works
			- Dramatic works
			- Sound recordings
			- Motion pictures (movies, videos...)
			- Etc..
	- CFAA: Computer Fraud and Abuse Act - 1986
		- Defines what actions constitute computer crimes
		- Access classified information or financial information in a federal system without authorization.
		- Use a federal computer to perpetrate fraud
		- Cause malicious damage in excess of $5,000
		- Amended in 1994 to cover more provisions
		- Any computer used in interstate commerce not just "federal interest" computer systems. (Latest amendment!)
	- NIIPA: National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996
		- Provided amendments to Computer Fraud and Abuse Act - Further protection it provides.
		- Protects national infrastructure: railroads, gas pipelines, power grids...etc.

THREAT MODELING:
	- Focuses on three common threat types:
		1. Attackers
		2. Assets
		3. Software

	- Security process where potential threats are identified, categorized and analyzed. 
	- Identifies potential harm, probability of occurrence, the priority of concern.
	- Identifies the means to eradicate or reduce the threat.

	- STRIDE Model: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privileges
	- Reduction Analysis: Break system down in to 5 trust boundaries.
	- Decomposing
	- Diagramming
	- DREAD (Risk Assessment Model)
		- DAMAGE POTENTIAL - How severe is the damage likely to be if the threat is realised?
		- REPRODUCIBILITY - How complicated is it for attackers to reproduce the exploit?
		- EXPLOITABILITY - How hard is it to perform the attack?
		- AFFECTED USERS - How many users are likely to be affected by the attack? (As a percentage)
		- DISCOVERABILITY - How hard/difficult is it for an attacker to discover the weakness?




Due Care vs Due Diligence:
	- Due Care:
		- Doing what a reasonable person would do. 
		- "Prudent man rule"
		- Informal.
		- Duty of Care.
	- Due Diligence:
		- Follows a process.
		- Step beyond due care.
		- To verify/confirm something is done correctly.

Gross Negligence:
	- Opposite of due care.
	- Legally important concept.
	- Unable to prove due care = bad legal position.

Evidence:
	- Real Evidence
		- Physical objects/ Tangible.
		- Knife, gun...etc.
	- Direct Evidence
		- Testimony provided by witnesses regarding experience through five senses.
	- Circumstantial Evidence
		- Establish circumstances related to particular points or other evidence.
	- Corroborative Evidence
		- Provides additional support for a fact that might have been called in to question.
	- Hearsay Evidence
		- Second-hand evidence
		- Indirect information
	- Secondary Evidence
		- Copies of original documents
		- Oral description
		- Computer-generated logs and documents

Best Evidence Rule:
Courts prefer the best evidence possible. 
	- Original documents over copies
	- Tangible real evidence over oral testimony or description

Evidence Integrity:
	- Must be reliable
	- Common during forensic and incident response
	- Checksums
	- Hashing / One-way hash functions
	- MD5 or SHA-1

Intellectual Property
	- Trademark
		- Associated with marketing
		- TM symbol = unregistered trademark
		- R symbol = formally registered trademark
		- Consists of word, name, symbol, colour, sound, product shape, design or combinations of these.
		- Must be distinctive. 
		- Registered with a gonvernment registrar
		- International harmonization of trademark laws began in 1883 with the Paris Convention.
		- World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) oversees international trademark law efforts - international registration.
	- Patent
		- Provides monopoly to the patent holder for right to use, make, or sell invention for a period of time. Promise to make public.
		- Excludes other from leveraging the patented invention.
		- Should be novel and unique.
		- Valid for 20 years from initial filing date. United States and Europe.
		- Strongest form of intellectual property protection.
		- WIPO - Agency of United Nations looks after the filing and processing of international patent applications.
	- Copyright
		- Artistic property, Writing, recordings, databses, computer programs.
		- DOES NOT COVER the ideas and/or processes behind the creation of intellectual property. 
		- Weaker than patent protection.
		- Minimum of 50 years after the creator's death.
		- 70 years under U.S. copyright protection.
		- Some countries may have slight variation.
		- Member of Berne Convention - afforded at least the minimum (50 years) level protection.
	- Trade secrets
		- Business-proprietary
		- Uses Noncompete and nondisclosure agreements (NDA)
		- Important for an organisations ability to compete

PRIVACY:
Protection of the confidentiality of personal information.

European Union Privacy
	- EU Data Protection Directive
	- Four (4) principals:
		1. Notifying individuals of how their personal data is collected and used
		2. Allowing individuals to opt out of sharing their personal data with third parties
		3. Granting individuals the right to opt into sharing the most sensitive personal data (as opposed to being opted in automatically)
		4. Providing reasonable protections for personal data.

European Union Privacy Laws (Cont.)
To qualify for the safe harbor provision, U.S companies conducting business in Europe must meet seven (7) requirements for the 
processing of personal information:
	1. Notice: Must inform individuals of what information they collect
	2. Choice: Must allow individuals to opt-out if the information used will be shared with a 3rd-party.
		- For sensitive information and "opt-in" policy must be used.
	3. Onward Transfer: Organisations can share data only with other organisations that comply with safe harbor principals.
	4. Access: Individuals must be granted access to any records kept containing their personal information. 
	5. Security: Proper mechanisms must be in place to protect against data loss, misuse, and unauthorized disclosure.
	6. Data Integrity: Organisations must take steps to ensure the reliability of the information they maintain.
	7. Enforcement: Organisations must make dispute resolution processes available to individuals and provide certifications to regulator agencies.


EU-US Safe Harbor
	- Authorised data sharing between the US and EU.
	- Department of Commerce hold this list of participating countries.

Import/Export Restrictions
	- During the Cold War - CoCom, the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls.
		- Multinational agreement restricting export of certain technologies - encryption.
	- After Cold War - Wassenaar Agreement
	- Wassenaar Agreement - Standard for export controls
		- Far less restrictive
		- Still places restrictions on the export of cryptographic algorithms

Access Control Defensive Categories and Types
Six control types:
	1. Preventive
		- Restricts what a potential user either authorized or unauthorized can do.
		- Preemployment drug screening. 
	2. Detective
		- Sends alerts during or after a successful attack.
		- Building alarm system
		- CCTV
		- Motion Detectors
		- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
	3. Corrective
		- Work by correcting a damaged system or process.
		- Typically works hand in hand with detective controls.
		- Antivirus software has both components.
	4. Recovery
	5. Deterrent
	6. Compensating
	7* Directive - Also referred to as administrative controls (policies, procedures, guidlines...etc) - Discretionary

The above control types fall into one of three categories:
	1. Administrative
		- Also called "Directive"
		- Implemented by creating organisational policy
		- Procedures
		- Regulations
		- User training and awareness
	2. Technical
		- Access control lists
		- Software, hardware, or firmware that restricts logical access.
		- Firewalls, routers, encryption...etc.
	3. Physical
		- Physical devices
		- Locks
		- Gates
		- Fences (Minimum defense)
		- Security Guards

Threats and Vulnerabilities
	- Threat = Potential harmful occurence, like an Earthquake, a power outage, or a network worm.
	- Vulnerability = A weakness that can allow a threat to cause harm.

RISK = THREAT X VULNERABILITY
Sometimes, risk = threat x vulnerability x impact is used.

Impact is the severity of the damage, sometimes expressed in dollars.
Loss of human life has infinite impact and must always be mitigated.

Risk Analysis:
	1. Qualitative
		- Uses risk analysis matrix
		- Opinion based
		- Identify liklihood, consequence risks
		- Intangible assets
	2. Quantitative
		- Facts based
		- Tangible assets
		- Numbers, ALE, ARO, SLE, AV, EF...
	3. Hybrid
		- Combination of both.

AV = Asset Value (Value of the asset)
EF = Exposure Factor (Percentage of asset value lost)
SLE = Single-loss Expectancy (Cost of one loss). AV x EF %.
ARO = Annual Rate of Occurence (number of losses per year).
ALE = Annualised Loss Expenctancy (Cost of losses per year). SLE x ARO.

TCO = Total Cost of Ownership. Total cost of a mitigating safeguard.
ROI = Return on Investment. Annual TCO should be less than your ALE. (TCO < ALE).

SAFEGUARD EVALUATION:
Formula = ALE before safeguard - ALE after implementing safeguard - annual cost of safeguard = value of safeguard to company.
Or... (ALE1 - ALE2) - ACS = value of safeguard to company.


RISK CHOICES

Accept Risk
	- Choosing not to implement a safeguard.
	- Leave asset unprotected, often due to costs/effort required to protect asset.
Mitigating Risk
	- Lowering the risk to an acceptable level.
Transferring Risk
	- Insurance
Risk Avoidance
	- Risk analysis deems risk not easily avoided.
	- Discontinue project or service.
Eliminate Risk (Impossible in most cases)
	- Completely remove the risk/threat 

RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
ISO 27005 - Risk Management
NIST Special Publication 800-30: Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems.
Nine-step risk analysis process:
	1. System Characterisation
	2. Threat Identification
	3. Vulnerability Identification
	4. Control Analysis
	5. Liklihood Determination
	6. Impact Analysis
	7. Risk Determination
	8. Control Recommendations
	9. Results Documentation

SIX STEPS OF RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK:
	1. Categorise (Assets, data, ..etc)
	2. Select (Controls)
	3. Implement
	4. Assess
	5. Authorise
	6. Monitor 

NIST SP 800-53: Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organisations

	- Deals with all aspects of security
	- Derived from COSO - Integrated control - Integrated Framework
	- IT Governance model
	- Operational focus
	- Goals for IT.

2. NIST SP 800-53 - Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organisations
	- Overlaps with COBIT
	- NIST is a nonregulatory body of the U.S Department of Commerce
	- Drives compliance with FISMA
	- Control categories: Operational, Technical, Management

3. COSO
	- Committee of Sponsoring Organisations 
	- Sponsored the Treadway Commission in 1985 to deal with fraudulent financial activities
	- COSO Internal Control Framework released in 1992. Last updated in 2013.
	- 17 internal control principals grouped in to five (5) internal control components:
		1. Control Environment
		2. Risk Assessment
		3. Control Activities
		4. Information Communication 
		5. Monitoring Activities
	- COSO IC Framework = CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (COBIT = IT GOVERNANCE)
	- Strategic level 
	- PRIVACY
	- Goals for Organisation as a whole.


CAPABILITY MATURITY MODEL INTEGRATION (CMMI):
	- Developed by Carnegie Mellon University for the U.S Department of Defense 
	- Level 0 - 5
		- L0 = Nonexistent management
		- L1 = Unpredictable processes
		- L2 = Repeatable processes
		- L3 = Defined processes
		- L4 = Managed processes
		- L5 = Optimised processes

DOMAIN 3: SECURITY ENGINEERING
***************************************************************************************************************************************

ACCESS CONTROL MODELS:
	- DAC (Subjects have full control over their data. Can allocate permissions to whoever they want)
	- MAC (Bell LaPadula, Biba, Clark Wilson)
	- Non-Discretionary (Role Based Access Control (RBAC))
		- Content-based access control
		- Context-based access control

Bell LaPadula:
	- Confidentiality model
	- Information flow model
	- Simple security rule = No Read Up (NRU)
	- * (Star) Security rule = No Write Down
	- Strong star property rule = Subject with read/write capabilities can ONLY perform those functions at the SAME security level as the subject.
		- Example: Secret subject can only read/write against secret objects.

Biba:
	- Integrity model, focused on integrity
	- Information flow model
	- Simple integrity axiom = No Read Down. Cannot read data at a lower classification level.
	- * (Star) integrity axiom = No Write Up. Cannot write data to a higher classification level.
	- Invocation property = A subject cannot request service (invoke/call upon) at a higher integrity level.

Clark-Wilson:
	- Developed after Biba model
	- Integrity focused
	- Two distinct functions:
		1. Well-formed transactions
		2. Separation of Duties
	- Uses the following elements:
		- Users: Active agents.
		- Transformation Procedures (TP). Programmed abstract operations, such as: read, write, modify...
		- Constrained Data Items (CDIs). Can only be manipulated by TPs
		- Unconstrained Data Items (UDIs). Can be manipulated by users via primitive functions like; read/write operations.
		- Integrity Verification Procedures (IVPs). Check consistency of CDIs with external reality.
	- Subjects can access objects only through authorized programs (access triple)
	- Auditing is required


Noninterference Model:
	- Multilevel security properties
	- Ensures that actions taken at a higher classification level do not affect (interfere) with actions taken at a lower level.
	- Not concerned with information flow of data. (NOT AN INFORMATION FLOW MODEL).
	- Focused with what a subject knows about the system state.
	- Aimed to prevent leak of information between subjects at differing classification levels.

Brewer and Nash Model:
	- Also called "Chinese Wall Model"
	- Subject can write to object ONLY IF subject CANNOT read another object within a different dataset
	- Created to provide dynamic access controls based on previous subject actions
	- Aimed to prevent conflict of interest.

Graham-Denning Model:
	- Shows how subjects and objects should be created and deleted. 
	- Addresses how to assign specific access rights.
	- Three parts: Objects, Subjects and Rules.
	- Granular approach for interaction between subjects and objects.
	- Eight (8) primitive protection rights:
		- R1: Transfer Access
		- R2: Grant Access
		- R3: Delete Access
		- R4: Read Object
		- R5: Create Object
		- R6: Destroy Object
		- R7: Create Subject
		- R8: Destroy Subject

Harrison-Ruzzo Ullman Model:
	- Access rights of subjects and integrity of those rights
	- A subject can carry out a finite set of operations on an object
	- Used mostly by software designers

COMPOSITION THEORIES:
	- CASCADING: Input for one system comes from the output of another system.
	- FEEDBACK: One system provides input to another system, which reciprocates by reversing those roles.
		- System A provides input for System B, and System B provides input for System A.
	- HOOKUP: One system sends input to another system but also sends input to external entities.





SECURITY STANDARDS:
ISO 27001: Focused on standardisation and certification of an organisations Information Security Management System (ISMS)
	- Inspired from BS 7799

ISO 27002: Guideline which lists security control objectives and recommends a range of specific security controls.
	- More granular than ISO 27001.
	- 14 areas
	- Inspired from BS 7799

TIMING ATTACKS:
TOCTOU - Time of Check / Time of Use.
	- Race condition exploit
	- Attack timing, transition between one system state to another
RACE - Two or more processes require access to the same resource and must complete their task in proper order for normal functions.


SYSTEM EVALUATION
Common Criteria Model
	- Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL)
	- Use of Protection Profiles (PP) - Independent set of security requirements & objectives for a specific category of products/systems 
	- 7 Levels of evaluation (see below)
	- Target of Evaluation (ToE)
	- Framework for users to specify requirements and how vendors can then meet/satisfy those requirements
	- Independent labs can verify claims of requirements satisfaction made by vendors 

Evaluation Assurance Levels:
	1. EAL1 - Functionally tested
	2. EAL2 - Structurally tested
	3. EAL3 - Methodically tested and checked
	4. EAL4 - Methodically designed, tested, and reviewed
	5. EAL5 - Semi-formally designed, tested
	6. EAL6 - Semi-formally verified, designed, tested
	7. EAL7 - Formally verified, designed, tested

TCSEC - Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria
	- Concentrates exclusively on confidentiality
	- Any system that changes must be re-evaluated
	- Replaced by the common criteria
	- Used in the 1990's
		- Category A: Verified protection. The highest level of security.
			- A1: Verified protection.
		- Category B: Mandatory protection.
			- B1: Labeled Security
			- B2: Structured Protection
			- B3: Security Domains
		- Category C: Discretionary protection.
			- C1: Discretionary protection
			- C2: Controlled Access Protection
		- Category D: Minimal protection. Reserved for systems that have been evaluated but do not meet requirements for other categories.

ITSEC - Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria
	- Minimal/no protection  			= ITSEC F-D+E0  = D (TCSEC)  = EAL0, EAL1 (CC) 
	- Discretionary security mechanisms		= ITSEC F-C1+E1 = C1 (TCSEC) = EAL2 (CC)
	- Controlled access protection 			= ITSEC F-C2+E2 = C2 (TCSEC) = EAL3 (CC)
	- Labeled security protections 			= ITSEC F-B1+E3 = B1 (TCSEC) = EAL4 (CC)
	- Structured security protection 		= ITSEC F-B2+E4 = B2 (TCSEC) = EAL5 (CC)
	- Security domains 				= ITSEC F-B3+E5 = B3 (TCSEC) = EAL6 (CC)
	- Verified protection 				= ITSEC F-B3+E6 = A1 (TCSEC) = EAL7 (CC)



CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION:
Current Department of Defense standard is Risk Management Framework (RMF).
	- Recently replaced DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP).
	- DIACAP itself replaced Defense Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP)

The standard for all US government branch departments, agencies, and their contractors and consultants is the
Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Policy (CNSSP).
	- CNSSP replaced National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (NIACAP).

CISSP may refer to the current standard or the previous ones. Both of these processes are divided into four phases:
	- Phase 1: Definition
	- Phase 2: Verification
	- Phase 3: Validation
	- Phase 4: Post Accreditation

Certification: Certification is the technical evaluation of each part of a computer system to assess its concordance with security standards.
	- Certification: Is often internal verification of security and the results of that verification are trusted only by your organisation.
Accreditation: Accreditation is the process of formal (often done by 3rd-party) acceptance of a certified configuration for a designated authority.
	- Accreditation is often performed by a 3rd-party testing service, the results are trusted by everyone in the world who trusts the specific testing service.



CLOUD COMPUTING:
PUBLIC CLOUD:
	- Outsources IT infrastructure (IaaS)
	- Storage 
	- Applications (Software as a Service - SaaS)
	- Web service hosting (Platform as a Service - PaaS)

PRIVATE CLOUD: Houses data for a single organisation, and may be operated by a 3rd-party, or by the organisation itself.
GOVERNMENT CLOUD: Designed to keep data and resources geographically contained within the borders of one country.
	- Designed for the government of the respective country.
HYBRID CLOUD: Houses a combination of public and private data/services.


Techniques for Ensuring Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:
SOFTWARE AND MEMORY SECURITY

CONFINEMENT:
	- Restrict the actions of a program
	- Read from and write to ONLY certain memory locations
	- Also known as Sandboxing
	- Offending process is terminated

BOUNDS:
	- Each process that runs on a system is assigned an authority level
	- Authority level tells operating system what the process can do
	- Consist of limits set on the memory addresses and resources it can access
	- Bounds state the area within which a process is confined or contained
	- Logical memory segmentation

ISOLATION:
	- Process confined through enforced access bounds - process runs in ISOLATION
	- Process isolation ensures that any behaviour will affect only the memory and resources associated with the isolated process
	- Isolation is used to protect the operating environment, the kernel of the OS, and other independent applications
	- Essential component of a stable operating system

MOTION DETECTORS:
	- Infrared
		- Detect significant or meaningful changes in the infrared lighting pattern
	- Heat-based
		- Detects changes in heat levels of a monitored area
	- Wave-pattern detector
		- Transmits a consistent low ultrasonic or high microwave frequency signal into a monitored area and monitors for significant/meaningful changes or disturbances in the reflected pattern.
	- Capacitance
		- Detects changes in the electrical or magnetic field surrounding a monitored area. Think "capactior = electrical"
	- Photoelectric
		- Detects changes in the visible light levels for the monitored area. Think "photo = vision or visible"

Service Organisation Controls (SOC)
SAS 70 - Statement on Auditing Standards (outdated - 2011) - *Replaced by SOC 1 reports*
Developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).
	- SOC 1: Pertains to Financial Controls.
	- SOC 2: Pertains to trust services (Security, Availability, Confidentiality, Process Integrity, and Privacy). High detail. Not to be shared publicly.
	- SOC 3: Also pertains to trust services. Less detailed than SOC-2. Can be disclosed to broad audience/public.
SOC Type I: Report covering a point in time. Reports on validity of policies and procedures.
SOC Type II: Report covering a period of time (Usually six months).

NIST Types:
NIST SP 800-137: Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) 


White/Crystal Box Testing: 
Grey Box Testing
Black Box Testing:

PENETRATION TESTING METHODOLOGY:
**Always seek approval from senior management/organisation before beginning any form of penetration testing**
	1. Planning
	2. Reconnaisance
	3. Scanning (also called Enumeration)
	4. Vulnerability Assessment
	5. Exploitation
	6. Reporting

TEST COVERAGE ANALYSIS vs CODE COVERAGE ANALYSIS:
	- Test coverage analysis
		- Use cases
		- Formula: Test coverage = number of use cases divided by total number of use cases

	- Code coverage analysis
		- Ensures all aspects of code are tested
		- Statements, functions, branches, conditions


****
DOMAIN 7: SECURITY OPERATIONS
****

WRT = Work Recovery Time
RTO = Recovery Time Objective
MTD = Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD = RTO + WRT)
RPO = Recovery Point Objective (Maximum loss of data or system inaccessibility (measured in time) that an organisation can withstand)
MTBF = Maximum Time Between Failure
MTTR = Mean Time To Repair
MOR = Minimum Operating Requirements

BCP/DRP - Business Continuity Planning / Disaster Recovery Planning
	- BCP provides procedures for sustaining essential business operations while recovering from a significant disruption. 
		- Contains BIA (Business Impact Analysis)
		- Goal of BIA is to determine the MTD.
	- DRP specific report tailored to the recovery and response to a disaster scenario.

FOUR STEPS OF THE BCP PROCESS:
1. Project Scope and Planning
2. Business Impact Assessment (5 steps)
	1. Identification of priorities

GENERIC DISASTER RECOVERY PROCESS //
	1. Respond
		- Initial assessment of damage
		- Will we need to use the DR site? 
	2. Activate Team
	3. Communicate
		- Provide status updates
	4. Assess
	5. Reconstitution

SECURE SOFTWARE DELEVOPMENT MODELS:
	- Waterfall
	- Sashimi
	- Spiral
		- Risk adverse
		- Risk assessments performed each round
	- Scrum (Agile) - Develops code/application as a team from start to finish. Rugby analogy.
	- Extreme Programming (Agile)
		- High importance placed on communication between customer/client and developement team
		- Development team collaboration



SOFTWARE CAPABILITY MATURITY MODEL
	- Developed by: Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Software Engineering Institute (SEI) 
	- Five levels of CMM:
		1. Initial
			- Competent people, informal processes, absence of formal processes.
		2. Repeat
			- Project management processes, basic life-cycle
		3. Defined
			- Engineering processes, precense of basic life-cycle management processes, reuse of code, QA, software project planning
		4. Managed
			- Product and process improved, quantitatively controlled
		5. Optimizing
			- Continuous process improvement, works with an IDEAL model
			- IDEAL:
				- Initiate: Begin effort. Support for the initiative is built.
				- Diagnose: Perform assessment.
				- Establish: Action plan.
				- Acting: Implement improvements. Stop talking and walk the walk. Develops solution, tests, refines, implements.
				- Learning/Leverage: Reassesses and continously improve.

SOFTWARE CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROCESS: Three Basic Components
1. Request Control
2. Change Control
3. Release Control

Programming Languages:
1GL - Machine Lanaguage/Code 
2GL - Assembly Languages
3GL - Compiled Languages
4GL - Programmers attempt to approximate natural languages and include SQL, which is used by databases
5GL - Programmers create code using visual interfaces

IDEAL Software Development Model:
I = Initiating
D = Diagnosing 
E = Establishing
A = Acting
L = Learning

"II DR ED AM LO (I..I Dr. Ed Am (Lo)w)"
