## Deploy and configure infrastructure (40-45%)
  - Analyze resource utilization and consumption
  - configure diagnostic settings on resources
  - create baseline for resources
    * [security baselines in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-security-baselines/)
  - create and test alerts
  - analyze alerts across subscription
  - analyze metrics across subscription
  - create action groups
  - monitor for unused resources
    * Azure Adviser provides recommendations for unused/under utilised resources.
  - monitor spend
    * Cost analysis feature: __subscription -> cost management -> cost analysis__
  - report on spend
  - utilize Log Search query functions
  - view alerts in Azure Monitor logs
  - visualize diagnostics data using Azure Monitor Workbooks
