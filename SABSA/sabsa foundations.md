# F1 Content
## Section 1 - SABSA Principals & Objectives
- #### Enterprise Security Architecture Framework
  - A consistent set of principals, policies, capabilities and standards that sets the direction and vision for the development and operation of the organisation's business information systems so as to ensure alignment with and support for the business needs.
- #### SABSA Guiding Principals
- #### Holistic Approach
- #### Features, Benefits, and Advantages

## Section 2 - SABSA Framework Overview
- #### The SABSA Matrix
- #### The Traceability Concept
  - Traceability for __Completeness__: Every business requirement for security is met and the residual risk is acceptable to the business appetite.
  - Tracebility for __Justification__: Every operational or technological security element can be justified by reference to a risk-prioritised business requirement.
  - Applications of Traceability:
    * Bi-directional - Completeness. Justification.
    * Actuarial Preservation - Controls. Enablers.
    * Manage Change - Confirm links not removed.
    * Knowledge Management - Re-use components. Predictability.
      
## Section 3 - Business Context & Requirements
- #### The Traceability Concept
  - Approach to traceability:
    * Good traceability requires small, credible steps, not big jumps
    * __Buzzwords__: Credible abstraction, business-drivers, two-way, business drivers for security. 
- #### Credible abstraction of business requirements
	- Meaningful traceabiity is enabled by credible abstraction from business context (assets, goals and objective) to a business security context
	- Traceability therefore starts by delivering two slightly different sets of requirements:
		1. Business Requirements - Business-level assets, goals and objectives.
		2. Business Drivers for Security - The business requirement abstracted into one or more statements of security-relevance to the business requirement
- #### SABSA Attributes
  - __Attributes Customisation__
    - The Attributes Profile represents the business requirements for security for a specific organisation and should be customised to fully reflect local needs & culture
    - Customised attribute names
    - Customised attribute definitions
    - Customised attribute measures, metrics & performance targets
    	- Advanced useage involves multiple domain levels with linkage and aggregated performance
  - Attributes can be tangible or intangible
  - Provides the "missing link" between business requirements and technology / process design
  - Powerful requirements engineering technique

## Section 4 - Risk & Opportunity Framework
- #### Role of Risk Management is Business & Architecture
  - Achieve an appropriate balance between realising opportunities for gains while minimising losses/threats.
  - Defined through 'Opportunities & Threats Inventory' (Contextual/Motivation - SABSA Matrix Cell)
  - Achieved through analysis of Internal & External Risk Factors
  - Establish an appropriate infrastructure and culture and apply a logical and systematic method
  - Embed into the organisation's philosophy, practices and business processes
  - Accountability assurance & governance
- #### Risk Assessment
  - __Advantages of the Impact-based Approach__
    - Much broader view of the business goals - not just the tangible assets
    - Provides a good view of business criticality
    - Allows priorities to be established
    - Uses language understood by business managers
    - Involves the business managers in the process
    - Speed, cost, usability
  - PESTELIM Analysis
    * Political Factors
    * Economic Factors
    * Social Factors
    * Technological Factors
    * Environmental Factors
    * Legal Factors
    * Industry Factors
    * Military Factors
  - SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)
- #### Risk Management Process
  - The SABSA Lifecycle with the addition of Assurance and Govern & Communicate.
  	- Strategy & Planning
	- Design
	- Implement
	- Manage & Measure
	- Assurance and Governance overlay
- #### Risk Management Systems
  - SABSA Risk & Opportunity Model
    - Risk Context: Negative Outcomes vs Positive Outcomes.
    - Threats vs Opportunities
    - Loss Event vs Beneficial Event
    - Impact is expressed as positive or negative consequences of potential events upon Attributes
    - Negative impact expressed as:
    	- Reduction in Attribute performance
	- Failure to meet Attribute performance target
    - Positive impact expressed as:
    	- Increase in Attribute performance
	- Increase in Attribute performance threshold to higher target
    - Controls (Protect from Negative Consequences) --> __Attribute__ <-- Enablers (Enhance for Positive Consequences)

## Section 5 - Policy Architecture
- #### Policy Framework
  - __ENTERPRISE POLICY:__
  	- Contextual Policy (Business View): Over-arching Business Risk Management Policy (Enterprise Wide)
  	- Conceptual Policy (Architect View): Policies for each Enterprise Risk Stategy (Enterprise Wide) - Sub-domains within Enterprise superdomain
  - __DOMAIN POLICY:__
  	- Logical Policy (Designer View): __Policies__ for each Risk Strategy (Domain Level)
  	- Physical Policy (Builder View): __Procedures & Practices__ for each Risk Strategy (Domain Level)
  	- Component Policy (Tradesman View): Detailed __Standards and Rules__ for each Risk Strategy (Domain Level)
  	- Operational Policy (Service Manager View): Detailed Security __Implementation & Operation Guides__ (Domain Level)
  - Each Policy Authority in the SABSA Policy Framework is accountable for the risks and opportunities to their own domain-level assets (attributes), goals & objectives
- #### Policy Domain Concept
  - A security domain is a set of elements subject to a common security policy defined and owned by a single security policy authority.
  	- Every domain has a Policy Authority - the owner of risk TO that domain
- #### Policy Domain Model
