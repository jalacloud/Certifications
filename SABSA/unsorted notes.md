__F1 	- Strategy & Planning__
	- Context and Concepts

__F2 	- Security Service Management__
	- Covers F1 and F2 material
	- Logical, Physical, Component layers.

Definition of a Firewall (Simplified in business terms) 
A technical implementation of permitted business rules - satisfying the business risk appetite.

Enterprise risk aggregation:
Risk aggregation happens top-down. CEO can't wear all hats for each area of the business.

Solution: Risk Register. Use to capture risks contained within each department/silo to aggregate all known risks to the business.

Concept of security = to support business objectives. Enable business, securely.

### EXAM Areas of Focus (AoF)

- Know the 6 views of SABSA architecture. Layered Architecture Views.
  - Remember: *BAD BTS*
    - Business's View
    - Architect's View
    - Designer's View
    - Builder's View
    - Trademan's View
    - Service Manger's View
- Business attributes taxonomy vs business attributes profile.

01. SABSA Concepts - Business Attributes Taxonomy vs. Business Attributes Profile

Business Attributes Taxonomy
- Name of attribute
- Description of attribute
- Classification of attribute

Business Attributes Profile
- Same variables as used in the taxonomy
- With the addition of:
	- Measurable approach
	- Metric
	- Performance Target

02. SABSA - Two-way Traceability

Traceability for completeness AND justification - Two-way traceability
	- Traceability for __COMPLETENESS__	
		- Every business requirement is met
	- Traceability for __JUSTIFICATION__
		- Every operational or technological security element can be justified

03. Business Context & Requirements

Approach to traceability:
Good traceability requires small, credible steps, not big jumps

Credible abstraction of business requirements
	- Meaningful traceabiity is enabled by credible abstraction from business context (assets, goals and objective) to a business security context
	- Traceability therefore starts by delivering two slightly different sets of requirements:
		1. Business Requirements - Business-level assets, goals and objectives.
		2. Business Drivers for Security - The business requirement abstracted into one or more statements of security-relevance to the business requirement

Approached to Risk Management:
- Achieve an appropriate balance between realising opportunities for gains while minimising losses.
- Opportunities and Threats Model

In the SABSA world operational risk can also be an upside risk.
  - Business enablement is achieved through excellence in operational processes, people, and technical systems
  - SABSA is a framework for achieving this excellence


SWOT = Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.
PESTELIM Analysis.

SABSA Service Management Matrix: List of actionable tasks to undertake at each SABSA layer.
SABSA Matrix: List of deliverables and outcomes from the tasks performed within the Service Management Matrix (above).

Preparation of Flash Cards

Policy Architecture - Section 7


KPI - Looks into the past. Previous performance statistics. Cannot reliably predict the future.
KRI - Looks into the future. 

Align SABSA Development Lifecycle to Deming model (PLAN. DO. CHECK. ACT)
Plan Do Check Act - Deming Model

PLAN = STRATEGY & PLANNING, DESIGN
DO = IMPLEMENT
CHECK, ACT = MANAGE & MEASURE



Define the domain types:
- Superdomains
- Sub-domains
- Peer domains
- Logical domains
- Physical domains

Types of Metrics
1. Qualitative (Soft)
2. Quantitative (Hard)
3. Descriptive
4. Comparitive
5. Predictive

Through-Life Vitality Framework

Systemic Risk (Check this)
 - Failure to successfully meet a performance target within a sub-domain causing business impact to a superdomain.

List and describe the four (4) Logical Relationships in Authentication
- Page 89 (F2 Content PDF)
	- Direct Authentication
	- Indirect in-line Authentication
	- Online Authentication
	- Offline Authentication

Security Processing Cycle

SABSA Fast-Track

Risk management:
You only devote attention to risks that meet or exceed your risk appetite. 
	- Primary risk threshold = Warning TO Unacceptable
	- Secondary risk threshold = Acceptable TO Warning

Policy: A vested interest MAKES things happen.
	- Policy should leverage vested interest.

Black box modelling & Logic Flow Analysis
- Inputs -> Transformation -> Outputs


Know the SABSA Governance Model
- Dotted line. Strategy & Planning vs Lower layers (Design, Implement, Manage & Measure)
- Roles and Accountability for each role.
- Accountable Domain Authority
- Responsible Entities
- Know all activities that take place in each phase.
- Trustee (delegated from Owner - above dotted line) vs Custodian (Responsible for activity)

Consulted, Informed - Happens East/West and North. Never south.


Concept of Trust and Trust Models in SABSA:
- Trust is a relational Business Attribute, not a technical one.
- Trust is an important concept relevant to business relationships.
- Trust is estabilished through registration by a mutually trusted third party within a given domain (logical or physical).

**Trust models, and trust concepts**
Also, trust modelling.

Conceptual Lifetimes and Deadlines:
Everything in security has a lifetime
